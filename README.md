## Important Details

1. Actual time taken to complete start to finish
-- 4 hrs

2. Thought process
-- Took some time to finalize the ui
-- Wanted to do it simpler and easier to maintain
-- Known bugs (localstorage was not updated when rating / like / dislike change)

3. Wishlist
Show a navbar with fav icon
On clicking tag all highly rated animals there
Add provision to support more animals (scalable ui)
UX can be improved a bit
